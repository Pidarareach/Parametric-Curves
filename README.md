# Parametric-Curves

**What is the program about?**


The program, written in C++ using OpenGL, graphs a number of parametric curves based on user input. The curves include: Limacon, Cardioid, Three-leaf Rose, Four-leaf Rose, and Spiral. When run, the user inputs an integer (1 to 5) corresponding to the curve they want plotted. The program calculates the corresponding polar coordinates, converts them to Cartesian coordinates, and then plots them using OpenGL's line drawing routine. It graphically visualizes mathematical equations and parametric forms.
